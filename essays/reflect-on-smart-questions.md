From my experience studying computer science, I always got more out of my professors knowing how to ask a question instead of what to ask. It seems like a weird concept so I’ll explain a bit. 

Knowing what to ask usually (not always) ends up with too vague of a question. For instance, from watching and hearing so many students within my classes ask questions there was a recurring pattern. It always ended up with the professor or teaching assistants asking to see the code and then asking them to repeat the question again. This is no different than just not asking the question at all, taking a picture of your code or problem and asking someone to fix it or what’s wrong. 

On the other hand, when you know how to ask a question, you are helping the person help you. Explaining what you want to do or what you have done, is extremely important. It gives them an idea of what to look for and although they may need to see the problem, you save a lot of time structuring the question that way.

So after reading [“How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2359226/rails-method-i-need-help) , I couldn’t help but agree. It made me realize that even questions I thought I structured well may not seem so to other people. Since they can’t read my mind, I can’t expect them to understand where I’m coming from with my question.

An example of a poorly formulated question is something I grabbed off of Stack Overflow. It was titled “Rails, method, I need help.” Just from reading this title, I don’t even know where to begin. I don’t even know what they’re asking for. For someone to answer this question, they would have to look at the code dump provided, than after a bunch of back and forths that depend on if they’re at their computers ready to reply, it just seems like too much effort and a headache. Which is exactly what the paper I read said to go against. 

While an example of a smart question could be something like [“How to change the URI (URL) for a remote Git repository?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432764/how-to-change-the-uri-url-for-a-remote-git-repository/2432799#2432799). From this alone, you know what needs to be done. Albeit, it’s not that complicated of a task, someone who knows how to work Git would solve this issue instantly. But that could be thanks to how this question was formulated. They specified it for Git repository, talked about the URL, a lot of information could have been left out causing for extra steps to clarify. Simplicity could have come from a well formulated question.

One of the most important things in software engineering is time management. Coding takes so much time and debugging takes just as long. When you have projects to do the last thing you want is to be stuck on an issue for an extended period of time. By making smart questions, you allow people to help you quickly and efficiently. Saving you time and getting you right where you need to.
