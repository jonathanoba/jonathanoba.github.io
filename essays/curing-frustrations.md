There’s nothing quite as frustrating as not being able to manifest something of your imagination. My entire experience with programming and software engineering in general is the frustration of being excited having an idea that I want to manifest and giving up halfway through as it never pans out the way I imagined. 

When dealing with html and css, here were all the tools that I needed to create exactly what I had in mind and yet, it never happened. I could never make anything that I thought was remotely appealing nor close to what I had imagined and so the introduction of Semantic UI was beyond comprehension. 

Using Semantic UI in replace of just regular html and css was really nice. Being able to create something that wasn’t so plain made me feel as though I had a more artistic nature than I actually did. However, it was a lot harder to use. 

Semantic UI has a lot of syntax and a wide library that is difficult to memorize and learn. There are useful websites that help you learn the entire library and yet I found myself time and time again looking at exactly what I needed and not understanding how to use it at all. 

I’m excited to see how much more I could do with semantic hopefully being able to make high end websites among other things. By the end of this class, I hope to be able to make a appealing portfolio website.
