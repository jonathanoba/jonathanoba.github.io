I’ve been a competitive swimmer for over 8 years of my grade school life and so when the learning methodology of athletic software engineering was introduced, it seemed like an intriguing idea. The introduction of WODs or “Work Out of the Day” was a really appealing idea. It trains you to think fast, to problem solve in a stressful environment, and be efficient in not only your code but your method. Due to the time restriction, you have to manage your time well. Attacking the problem and trying to find shortcuts to save time and of course memory if you have that leeway. 

Currently, there has only been a single practice wod and it was genuinely stressful. What made it even harder was having a partner. Working together with someone and trying to understand their mindset is difficult. It’s hard to understand a teammate you just met and work together in a moment. And of course the pressure of not wanting to make a mistake and holding your teammate back. But from this one experience, I learned a lot. Luckily I had a teammate who knew what he was doing. We were able to understand each other, help each other, and mostly correct each other had something gone wrong. 

I think this method of stressful application and problem solving is really useful for me. Of course it helps you in the future with potential code interviews but, it helps me understand the language I’m using at a higher level. Javascript is not a language I’m used to and when you’re under a lot of pressure and have time restrictions, it shows you just how much you really know about the language. Why you choose certain methods over each other and figure out how your brain thinks under pressure. Each language has its own unique library and with that comes its own unique problem solving methods so figuring out how you approach a problem in the moment may even reveal what language you have an affinity for.

I’m excited to continue trying this method of learning and hope that it will help me become a better programmer but also understand myself a bit more.
