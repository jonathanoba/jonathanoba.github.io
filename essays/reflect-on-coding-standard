The coding standard can come across as a real hassle. Everyone has their own method of working and most people would think that as long as it works for you and you are able to get things done, it should be fine. Unfortunately, I think this misconception comes from how people perceive programmers to begin with. They are thought of to be antisocial, independent workers and perhaps to an extent it’s true for their personalities, but the business doesn’t allow it. 

Programmers will more often than not, always be working in some type of team or group. This improves efficiency, development, and allows for creative expansions. For this reason, I believe that coding standards were implemented. Just like how one would have a difficult time understanding, let alone reading, someone who had awful handwriting, someone with awful coding standards would make working together near impossible. You’d have to constantly try to figure out what they’re trying to do and what does what, which is valuable time wasted. 

Of course it doesn’t only deal with working together with people, when needing help for your code, if your code is near unreadable, it would be too much of a hassle to help figure it out. It would take too much time trying to figure out how the programmer is thinking and what they’re trying to achieve. 

Working with ESLint was a bit of a struggle but fortunately, not too much. There were only a few spacing corrections I needed to make which made my code look a bit more aesthetically pleasing. As of now, it’s hard to say whether or not ESLint or coding standards in general would help learn a programming language better as once you start coding a certain way, it’s hard to purposely go against the standard to make a point. I don’t think I have seen many examples of poor standards whilst learning a new language so I’m unsure of how accurate the statement is. However, based off of how I said it makes things easier to read, I can see how it would be easier for certain people. Unfortunately though, that’s just how learning is. Everyone learns differently but the important part is that they’re learning.
