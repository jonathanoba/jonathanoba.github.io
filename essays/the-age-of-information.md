One of the most important aspects of building a solid relationship is trust. Knowing that the person you are trusting is not going to take advantage of you, doesn't have an ulterior motive in getting to know you, and allows you to feel as though you have a choice. A choice to choose whether you are comfortable enough to share certain types of things to them. The person may be someone you trust to give general information to but maybe not personal information that perhaps not even close family members would know.

What people tend to forget is that in relation to software engineers and tech in general, consumers are trusting these companies and workers with absolute trust that the information they provide will not be used in any way against them. Keeping in mind that some, if not nearly most, of consumers are not being given a choice to trust these companies. 

An example is one of the most common concerns which is terms of service. Terms of service refers to a list of guide lines and clauses that explain very clearly towards users what using this produce entails. That if you do not accept these terms of service, you will not be able to use the product. However, in nearly my entire life, I have never met a single person who read through an entire outline. This is no different then signing a contract without even reading it, but we as people have become accustomed to it, blindly trusting that companies will not put anything in the statement to undermine the consumers. 

But we know that's not the case. One of the biggest topics of recent days were how Facebook would sell users personal data to just about anyone willing to buy it. That it would track what you searched, webpages you went to, topics you'd frequent, videos you'd watch, items you'd buy, etc. and sell this information to companies to have a better audience of advertisements. Of course these are just the minor ethical issues that Facebook has been apart of and not at all close to the scale in which Mr. Zuckerberg had to talk to congress about. All of this just falls onto the overarching theme of trust between a company and it's consumers.

I believe there needs to be more communication between the two parties. That if a company wants to use all this personal information from a user, they should make it aware to the user that it is something being done and whether their information is safe. I believe in the case of Facebook, it turned out there was an option to supposedly "stop" information from being gathered and sold off to companies but it was in a completely obscure location with no real noticable way of recognizing that this setting is what causes it. 

It's unfortunate that the current climate of things seems to be revolved around some sort of agenda or money making scheme but that has been a part of history. It just doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth where a company like Facebook who essentially monopolizes the social media market forces people to these terms because they truly have no other option.
