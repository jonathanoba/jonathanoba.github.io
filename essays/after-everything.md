When discussing software engineering, it's easy to somewhat get lost at the vast amount of work that they can potentially do. From web development, software development, to network and server systems, even operating systems, the term software engineer covers many bases. So when I went dove into software engineering myself, I knew I'd only be hitting the tip of the iceberg. Some facets that really stuck with me throughout my learning process was the introduction of User Interface Frameworks and Open Source Software Development.

User Interface Frameworks are software tools for software programs to run on the web. The one that I got the most experience with was called React. What React showed me was just how helpful these frameworks can be. With the extensive library that allows you to pretty much do anything you want it was extremely eye opening. One of the most impressive aspects of these frameworks is not only what they have but the ability to access information on the frameworks so easily. There are many websites and other external sources that provide many explanations and information on certain functions and other aspects of the framework that make learning and applying things much easier. 

The focus of the course was mostly on web development and through the use of React, I was able to emulate and copy a lot of websites that I thought were really unique and interesting. Learning the methods of thinking and plannign a design and then being able to actually produce it is a really satisfying feeling. 

The other concept that stuck with me was Open Source Software Development which essentially is taking public code (which tends to be something like a template to get started) and being able to build off of that. On top of this, the ability to work together with other people remotely and as a group to create a single project together. 

Doing some research, I noticed that a lot of projects actually start with an open source development. Having something to start with and not starting from scratch makes things much easier to build something visible. The concept I like to think of is the same as a hello world project to just beging things and creating something from it. 

For the course, we used a lot of meteor templates to start things off and it made it really easy to build our web applications as everything was already labeled and organized in a well manner. 

Software engineering is definitely something I take an interest in. The work we did was much more interactive and less theory which I found myself to really enjoy and excel at.
