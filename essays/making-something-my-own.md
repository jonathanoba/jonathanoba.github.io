Over the course of my life I found that I enjoy building and creating things. From a very young age I would build things out of cardboard boxes, assemble structures such as an at home arcade style basketball game, and even to the extent of taking things apart and trying to put them back together. As my parents started scolding me more and more to stop taking apart things as I would more often than not, be unable to put them back together, I slowly started getting into technology. From games, to websites, to even music, art, and videos, these were all things people were making and I wanted in. I soon found out that I’m fairly tone deaf (at least according to my parents) so music slowly faded out, and despite my father being an artist, I was unable to attain even a portion of that artistic gene. So as I slowly had each dream crushed by reality, as reality does, coding was still on the table. I still remember my first program tutorial which was a really simple Black Jack game. It was all done within the developer console and it would only spit out the numbers but, I was still able to play it.

As time continued to go on, my interest in creating things grew. From simple applications like a calculator to a unit conversion program that I used for my physics class. Till this day, I enjoy figuring it out and trying to create something of my own despite calculators existing and people who have already made useful conversion programs. I just enjoy making things that are mine and that’s what I hope to do with software engineering. I still haven’t developed a website of any kind and things that would use a server to have other people be able to access my projects. It’d be really fun to create something that not only I use but others as well. 

At the end of the day, it’s not my goal to get into any big companies, make some type of ridiculous salary, and live a stressful life. I just want to have fun. Making things that pop into my head and maybe even being able to create things that make my day to day life easier. I hope that through classes and lessons that I am able to achieve my ultimate goal of just not being bored. That if there’s a company doing a really interesting project that peaks my interest, I am able to have the skill set and experience to join them and be apart of the fun.
