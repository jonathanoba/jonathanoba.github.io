One of the issues I've had when programming is not recognizing the longevity of my code. What does that mean? Well I'm talking about the purpose of my code and where it will be down the line. When a lot of projects done are in the moment and not over the course of months, it's easy to overlook something so simple as design. We write our code, read our code and we know exactly what it says, what it does, how it works, etc. But what happens when you want to look back at it, let's say, a year from now. Would someone be able to pick up from the exact same mindset they had? I'm not too sure.

One of the most useful things in coding is creating a pattern for yourself. And typically, you end up at three roads, Behavioral; Creational; Structural. These are pretty straight forward. One deals with interactions, one deals with creating, and one deals with breaking things apart. Even when you don't actively try to do this, you may find yourself doing this without even meaning to. 

I won't go into detail about what each one really is or how they work because that isn't the point of this. I am here just expressing my appreciation of these patterns that aren't really taught to us and yet still appear everywhere. 

How often do I create classes that create objects and structuring my code to implement the class. I could have easily done it within the block of main code but it just doesn't feel right. And at times, your ideas may change and you may want to reuse some functions to do the same task and you will appreciate the ability to just call back something you made rather than recreating it every time. 

The beauty in design is not only it's readability but also it's friendliness. It's important to remember that most of the time, we work together. Having an easy to follow, recognizable pattern goes a long way.
