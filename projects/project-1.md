summary: I Wrote A Web Novel
---

About a year ago I started to write a web novel which I would upload to a website called Royal Road. It’s a website where anyone can upload their work for people to view, comment on, and rate. 

I’ve always wanted to create something of my own whether it’d be music, videos, programs, and even books so I took a leap of faith and started on this project. It was quite ambitious of me really as it was something I started during the school year and I slowly found out that I was unable to keep up with it. 

Web novels are typically different than your ordinary books or narratives. It’s usually done on a weekly basis and not published all at once. This means that one of the most important aspects of these types of novels is the pacing. Knowing how to end each weekly chapter correctly so that readers wouldn’t feel put off at an awkward ending of a segment. You would need to plan out and storyboard how you would end it so that things made sense.

The novel I started had over 2000 total views and an average of around 250 views per chapter. I uploaded 8 chapters until I was finally unable to keep up and had to tell the consistent readers that due to schedule I was unable to continue. 

It was an amazing experience publicly publishing my work as I had awful writing skills and still do. I had many commenters that criticized me and even helped me become a better writer. Giving me tips on what I could do better but also complimenting me on what I did well. 

As I am writing this, it’s actually been nearly a year since I’ve visited my novel on the website and it’s actually surprising how many people have read my work. I remember when I was uploading them I only had about 80 total viewers which I thought were amazing. But to see over 200 viewers consistently reading the chapters is really surprising.  It tells me that there were around 200 people who were willing to ignore all my grammatical errors and awkward writing habits because I was able to hook them onto the vision of this world I had wanted to build.

As someone who dislikes leaving things that I have started unfinished, it’s motivating me to try again and attempt to finish my story. Hopefully those who kept up with it will be happily surprised if I do so.
