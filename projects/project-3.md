summary: The lessons I've learned from getting injured through swimming.
---
I used to be a competitive swimmer for over 8 years of my life during grade school. I went through a lot of high highs and  an extremely low low. There has been nothing else in my life that has made me grow as a person than my days in swimming. I learned how to be disciplined, manage my time, and I think most importantly of all being persistent. 

I was extremely lucky to have been talented in swimming and within a short amount of time, was able to rank highly within Hawaii’s club scene. I encountered some hardships of relationships, how to handle sportsmanship, and most unfortunately; what happens when you don’t stand up for yourself.

Around my sophomore year of highschool, I had fractured my spine causing immense pain and even complete numbness from my legs down. This was a turning point for me. I grew up in an asian household where respect was valued highly. Teachers, coaches, adults; they would all be treated as though they were your parents. And so when I transferred from a ‘lax’ team to a ‘hardcore’ one, my body felt the difference. I was pushed extremely hard by my new coaches and I listened to them and not my body. I kept pushing and pushing until one day I woke up just to fall back down. 

It’s a permanent injury that I have till this day where if you were to take an x-ray of my spine, you would see a slight crack in it which is where my fracture is. The only way to fix it would be through surgery and filling it with metal. 

This taught me an important lesson in my life where you know you the best. It’s good to be pushed especially if you are not a disciplined person. If you have a hard time being motivated, it’s good to have someone to push you. Whether it’s in sports or academics or whatever it is you’re working on. However, you need to know when to stop and give yourself a break. Whether it’s studying every single day for hours trying to get ahead and pass the class, or trying to become the best at something. When you push too hard, eventually, something breaks. Luckily for me, it wasn’t a huge physical trauma. It has saved me from potential mental breakdowns of trying too hard to achieve things that can wait.
