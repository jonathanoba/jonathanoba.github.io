summary: Creating a Youtube Channel With My Friends

Over 10 years ago, there was a game I played a lot during my early grade school days called Combat Arms. As someone who came from playing games like Counter-Strike, I was really into games from the genre of First Person Shooter. In Combat Arms, there was a game mode called quarantine. It was essentially a game of tag where infected players would run around and try to infect the other players. If all players were infected, the infected win. If the players were able to kill the infected, the players win. 

This game mode was the first of its kind for me as most shooters were just that, shooters. However, this game mode allowed for a new type of play style which we called Free Running. Free Running was the idea of instead of grouping up and using teamwork to survive the infection, we would use our movement skills to try and outrun and out maneuver the infected players. 

Till this day, I have not been able to find something that filled me with as much excitement and stress at the same time. Where if you were the last person alive, it was you against 15 other players who were trying to hit you just once. As one hit was all it took for you to be infected. The adrenaline rush I would feel as I become hyper focused on trying to survive is what I loved about it. 

As time went by and I got better and better, people who would do this same style of game play began to get together, and we decided to form a clan called ProjectQuar. This led us into creating a youtube channel by the same name. Our goal was to create this elite group of members that had this particular skill at a very high level. Unfortunately as time went on, the game slowly died out and people’s lives got busy. I eventually gave my account away to someone after a few years of making the clan and moved onto other things. 

Should the game go back to it’s former glory and I somehow get in contact with those people, I would love to play again for a bit.
